            1. Creating a Person's profile:
        
                A sample curl request can be made by the following way:
        
                    curl -X POST http://localhost:6543/person/
                        {
                          "first_name": "Kushal",
                          "surname": "Ahmed",
                          "date_of_birth": "Dec 20 1984",
                          "sex": "M",
                          "email": "kushal.ahmed@griffithuni.edu.au"
                        }
        
                It returns the id of the person in a json format. For example,
        
                     {
                        "person_id": 123456
                     }
        
                Field Restrictions:
        
                    1. The field 'date_of_birth' must be in '%b %d %Y' format, e.g. "Dec 20 1984".
                    2. The field 'sex' can take only 'M' or 'F'. Here, 'M' indicates male and 'F' indicates female.
                    3. The fields 'first_name' and 'email' must NOT be null.
        
        
             2. Reading a Person's profile:
        
                A sample curl request can be made by the following way:
        
                    curl GET http://localhost:6543/person/123456
        
        
                It returns the person's profile in a json format. For example,
        
                     {
                       "first_name": "Kushal",
                       "surname": "Ahmed",
                       "date_of_birth": "Dec 20 1984",
                       "sex": "M",
                       "email": "kushal.ahmed@griffithuni.edu.au"
                     }
